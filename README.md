# AKKA Webcrawl

Akka webcrawl is a learning initiative to build a data pipeline of the following:

```
1) Distributed web crawler which saves to a NoSQL DB
2) Elastisearch which allows for easy querying capabilities of crawled content
3) Social Graph addon that lets us visualize the relations between entities in our emails
```


This is the initial demo project
